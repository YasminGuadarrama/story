	<h2> Chatper Four: Bluey gives Pinky a special rock </h2>
	<p>As Bluey comes home and hands Pinky the four other fish they caught. Then they say, "Pinky I have a suprise for you, close your eyes." Pinky closes her eyes and has both hands up palms open, Bluey drops the rock they brought home into her hands. Pinky opens her eyes and see the fish like rock. Bluey says,"So we always have fish at home." Pinky says,"Thank you." and puts the rock on top of their table inside their igloo to look at. </p>
